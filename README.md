SECTION A 
A 1. Let   X   ,   Y   and   Z   be   topological   spaces.
(a)    Deﬁne   what   it   means   for   a   map   f   : X   →   Y   to   be   continuous.          [4   marks]
(b)    For   each   of the   following   statements   determine   whether   it   is   true   or   false.   Prove   or   construct   a   counter-example.
i.   The   map   f   is   continuous,   if   and   only   if   for   every   open   set   U ⊆ X   its image   f   (U)   is   open   in   Y.
ii.   The   map   f   is   continuous,   if   and   only   if   for   every   closed   set   C ⊆ Y   its   inverse   image   f-1   (C)   is   closed   in   X   .
iii.   The   map   f   is   continuous,   if   and   only   if   for   every   closed   set   C ⊆ X   its   image   f   (C)   is   closed   in   X   .    [12   marks]
A 2. Let {Xi}i∈I      be   a   family   of   topological   spaces   and  the   Cartesian product   of   {Xi}.
(a)    Deﬁne   the   product   and   the   box   topologies   on   X   .    (There   is   no   need   to
verify   that   it   satisﬁes   the   topology   axioms.)                                                                                              [5   marks]
(b)    For   each   of the   following   statements   determine   whether   it   is   true   or   false.   Prove   or   construct   a   counter-example.
i.   If   I   is   ﬁnite   then   the   product   and   the   box   topologies   coincide.ii.   The   projections   πi    : X   →   Xi    are   all   continuous,   where   X   is   assumed   to   be   equipped   with   either   the   product   topology   or   the   box   topology.
iii.   Let  be   a   countable   product   (where   R   is   equipped
with the   standard topology).    Then the   box topology   on   X   is   strictly   ﬁner   than   the   product   topology   on   X   .  [11   marks]
A 3. Let   X   be   a   topological   space.
(a)    Deﬁne   what   it   means   for   X   to   be   connected,   what   it   means   for   X   to   be   path-connected,   and   what   it   means   for   X   to   be   compact.       [3   marks]
(b)    For   each   of the   following   statements   determine   whether   it   is   true   or
false.   Prove   or   construct   a   counter-example.
i.    Every   compact   subspace   of R   is   connected.
ii.   If X   is   connected   and   Y ⊆ X   is   closed   then   Y   is   connected.
iii.   If   X   is   compact   and   Y ⊆ X   is   closed   then   Y   is   compact.
iv.    Every   compact   subspace   Y ⊆ X   of a   compact   space   X   is   closed   in   X   .        [9   marks]
(c)            i.    Deﬁne   the   decomposition   of X   into   the   connected   and   the
path-connected   components.    (If you   deﬁne   it   as   the   set   of
equivalence   classes   then   there   is   no   need   to   validate 代 写6CCM327A Topology Summer 2018R

ii.    Prove   that   the   connected   components   {Ci}i∈I    are   disjoint   subsets   of   X,   such   that   every   connected   subspace   intersects   at   most   one   of them.    [6   marks]
SECTION B 
B 4. (a)   Prove the Intermediate Value Theorem:   if f   : X   → R   is a continuous
map deﬁned on a connected topological space   X,   then   if for   some
a,   b   ∈ X   we   have   f(a) < f (b), then for every f(a) < r < f (b) there exists a point c ∈ X such that f (c) = r. [5 marks]

i.e.   adding the real line to A   (thinking of R ⊆ R2      via the imbedding
x   }→   (x,   0)).   A brief argument is sufficient.

ii.    Does   there   exist   an   open   set   A ⊆ [—1, 1]   × R   that   contains   {0}   × R   but   does   not   contain   any   set   of   the   form   [—∈, ∈]   × R   for   ∈   >   0?
Explain   why   your   answer   does   not   contradict   the   Tube   Lemma.       [7   marks]
